####### SHOULD WORK WELL (I HOPE)
## ALREADY TESTED WITH TRUFFLE NO GUARANTEES THOUGH
This is a Crowdfunding Contract
## FEATURES
User sets the stop time (in unix time - seconds)
The start time function returns the current timestamp for reference
User Sets the crowdfunding target
if the target is reached before the time elapses the Contract
automatically transfers the reward to the beneficiary
if the target is not reached and time is elapsed funders can Call the Refund function
only if those conditions are met to recieve their funds back

##IMPORTANT 
Set target or else you will have an invalid contract which cannot crowdfunding
apart from that everything seems fine (i hope no assurances)
